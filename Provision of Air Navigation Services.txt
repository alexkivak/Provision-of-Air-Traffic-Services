What is ATS? 
Air Traffic Services(ATS) main purpose is to ensure safe and orderly traffic flow (ATC), 
provide necessary information to flight crews (FIS) and, in case of an emergency, to the 
appropriate (e.g SAR) bodies (alerting services). 
ATC - Air Traffic Control 
● Service provided to prevent collisions between aircraft and to expedite and 
maintain an orderly flow of air traffic
 ACC
 APP
 TWR
(A)FIS - (Aerodrome) Flight Information Service
 ● Flight Information service is a service provided for the purpose of giving advice 
and information useful for the safe and efficient conduct of flights. (ICAO Annex 
11: Air Traffic Services)
 ● Service is given in uncontrolled airspace
Alerting Services
 ● Service provided in order to inform the appropriate organisations regarding 
aircraft in need of search and rescue aid and assist such organisations as required
 ● The Police and Border Guard Board and Rescue Board are responsible for the 
implementation of SAR services for civil aviation throughout the Estonian SRR. 
What is ATF(C)M? 
The primary objective of air traffic flow (and capacity) management is to regulate the 
flow of aircraft as efficiently as possible in order to avoid congestion of certain control 
sectors. 
NMOC (Network Manager Operation Centre) optimises traffic flows by constantly 
balancing capacity supply and demand while ensuring safe and efficient operation of 
flights going to and over Europe.

NMOC process
 ● Collect aeronautical data
 ● Up-to-date Central Airspace and Capacity Database
 ● Flight planning
 ● Strategic flow management (seven days or more) 
● Pre-tactical flow management (one to six days before)
 ● Tactical flow management (on the day of the operations) 
● Post-operational analysis
 ● Flight data
What is ASM? 
Airspace management purpose is to manage airspace as efficiently as possible in order to 
satisfy its many users- both civil and military. 
ASM applies and enhances the Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) concept by developing the 
European airspace into one continuum that is flexible and reactive to changes in airspace 
users needs. 
ATM concepts
Flexible Use of Airspace
 ● Airspace is no longer “civil” or “military”
 ● Any necessary airspace segregation is temporary, based on real-time usage within 
a specific time period. 
● Contiguous volumes of airspace are not constrained by national boundaries.
Benefits
 ● Increased flight efficiency 
● Availability of military training areas
 ● Improved real-time civil/military cooperation
 ● A reduction in airspace segregation needs
 ● An increase in ATC capacity 
● A reduction in delays to general air traffic 
● More efficient ways to separate operational and general air traffic
FRA - Free Route Airspace
 • Giving users the freedom to plan a route in Europe’s airspace
 • Free route airspace (FRA) is a specified airspace within which users may freely plan a 
route between a defined entry point and a defined exit point, with the possibility to 
route via intermediate (published or unpublished) significant points, without 
reference to the ATS route network, subject to airspace availability.

● PBN - Performance based navigation concept specifies that aircraft RNAV or RNP 
system performance requirements be defined in terms of accuracy, integrity, 
continuity and functionality required for the proposed operations in the context of 
a particular airspace concept, when supported by the appropriate navigation aid 
infrastructure.

● ATS routes - An ATS route is a specified route designed for channelling the flow of 
traffic as necessary for the provision of air traffic services. 
Departure and arrival trajectories
 ● SID/STAR charts
 ● A Standard Instrument Departure Route (SID) is a standard ATS route identified in 
an instrument departure procedure by which aircraft should proceed from take
off phase to the en-route phase
 ● A Standard Arrival Route (STAR) is a standard ATS route identified in an approach 
procedure by which aircraft should proceed from the en-route phase to an initial 
approach fix.

Clearance
 ● Controllers should pass a clearance slowly and clearly
 ● Controllers should avoid passing a clearance to a pilot engaged in complicated 
taxiing manoeuvres and on no occasion should a clearance be passed when the 
pilot is engaged in line up or take-off manoeuvres
 ● Read-back requirements have been introduced in the interests of flight safety
Clearance
 ● The following shall always be read back: 
1) ATC route clearances
 2) clearances and instructions to enter, land on, take off from, hold short of, cross 
and backtrack on any runway; and 
3) runway-in-use, altimeter settings, SSR codes, level instructions, heading and 
speed instructions and, whether issued by the controller or contained in ATIS 
broadcasts, transition levels

RAM 
● To assist ATC in the early identification of a variation between the actual and the 
expected trajectory. 
● Provides advance warning in case of lateral deviation which could lead to loss of 
separation or airspace infringement.

approach track within 10NM of the runway threshold. 
Radar separation minima
Procedural separation
 ● Term used to indicate that information derived from an ATS surveillance system is 
not required for the provision of air traffic control service. 
● Typical applications for procedural control include: - in airspace where surveillance cover is not available ( e.g oceanic airspace) - in terminal movement areas if the traffic levels are such that they do not warrant 
the installation and maintenance of a surveillance system- in aerodrome control zones, especially if the traffic density is relatively low and 
the aerodrome layout is not complex ( e.g only one runway)- backup solution in case of complete failure of all surveillance-based systems

approach and other arriving and departing aircraft 
● For successive visual approaches, separation shall be maintained by the controller 
until the pilot of a succeeding aircraft reports having the preceding aircraft in 
sight. 
Separation for departing aircraft
 ● A departing aircraft will not normally be permitted to commence take-off until the 
preceding departing aircraft has crossed the end of the runway-in-use or has 
started a turn or until all preceding landing aircraft are clear of the runway-in-use

Ground based safety nets
What are safety nets? 
● Safety nets help prevent imminent or actual hazardous situations from developing 
into major incidents or even accidents. In doing so, they provide additional safety 
barriers in the overall system. 
● They are intended to provide timely alerts to air traffic controllers or pilots of an 
increased risk to flight safety. 
Ground-based and airborne safety nets
 ● Ground-based safety nets are an integral part of the ATM system. Primarily using 
ATS surveillance data, they provide warning times of up to two minutes. Upon 
receiving an alert, air traffic controllers are expected to immediately assess the 
situation and take appropriate action. 
● Airborne safety nets provide alerts and resolution advisories directly to the pilots. 
Warning times are generally shorter, up to about 40 seconds. Pilots are expected 
to immediately take appropriate avoiding action. 
Ground based and airborne safety nets
 ● Ground-based and airborne safety nets operate independently, often within the 
same airspace. The ground-based safety nets STCA and APW work alongside their 
airborne equivalent Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), also known as 
Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). STCA directly assists in 
preventing collision between aircraft whilst APW does so indirectly by predicting 
or detecting violations of traffic segregation rules. 
● Both MSAW and APM assist in preventing controlled flight into terrain accidents, 
and should work in concert with their airborne equivalent Ground Proximity 
Warning System. 
Ground-based safety nets
 ● STCA - Short Term Conflict Alert
 ● APW - Area Proximity Warning
 ● APM - Approach Path Monitor
 ● MSAW - Minimum Safe Altitude Warning
STCA
 ● Collision avoidance
 ● Ground: STCA Alert Received -> Resolving Action Determined -> Instruction Issued -> Read-back Received -> Progress Observed -> Implementation Verified -> 
Situation Observed
Minimum safe altitude warning
 ● MSAW can only generate alerts for aircraft that are equipped with pressure 
altitude-reporting transponders. 
APW
 ● Uses surveillance data and flight path prediction to warn the controller when an 
aircraft is, or is predicted to be, flying into a volume of notified airspace, such as 
controlled airspace, danger areas, prohibited areas and restricted areas. 
● Intended to function in the short term, up to 2 minutes
Approach Path Monitoring
 ● Approach Path Monitor warns the controller about increased risk of controlled 
flight into terrain accidents by generating, in a timely manner, an alert of an 
unsafe aircraft flight path during final approach
Airborne collision avoidance systems
 ● ACAS/TCAS 
● Tracks aircraft in the surrounding airspace through replies from their air traffic 
control transponders. If the system diagnoses a risk of impending collision, it 
issues a resolution advisory to the flight crew, which directs the pilots how best to 
regulate or adjust their vertical rate so as to avoid a collision. 
● Traffic advisories (TA) aims to help the pilots in the visual acquisition of the 
intruder aircraft and to alert them to be ready for a potential resolution advisory
Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System
 ● Reduces the risk of controlled flight into terrain by providing flight crews with 
timely, accurate information about terrain and obstacles in the area.
